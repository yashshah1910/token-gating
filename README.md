# Token Gating (Under Development)

Token Gating introduces safe token-gating solutions, enabling users to prove ownership of NFTs without connecting or even carrying their wallet on Flow blockchain. It eliminate the risk of connecting your wallet just to prove ownership of your token.

For verifiers, just enter the NFT contract address and scan the QR code of the user's wallet address. Users will enjoy security while being able to unlock the token utility.

For users they simply have to show qr code of their wallet address to verifiers, it will verify that the required tokens are present in your flow wallet.

## Website Workflow

Here is a sketch of the website workflow that was drawn on a whiteboard:
